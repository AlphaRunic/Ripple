## About

Ripple is an open-source all-purpose Discord bot built with TypeScript. Ripple's source code also may serve as a framework to your own Discord bot!

## Features

Ripple is a small bot currently, but has 30+ commands. Ripple also supports quoted arguments. This means that if you want a string with spaces in it to be treated as one argument while executing a command, you may surround it in quotation marks.  
Here's an example: `::say "hello, world!"`

## Installation

Ripple can be added to your server in just a few seconds!  
Just click this link: [Invite Me! üîó](https://bit.ly/2SjjB3d)

## Using Source Code

Ripple can be cloned directly from it's repository for the latest version. To make things easier, an NPM package is provided to help install everything cleanly.  

Install via `npm install ripple-discord-ts` or visit the [NPM package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ripple-discord-ts).
