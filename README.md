## About

Ripple is an open-source all-purpose Discord bot built with TypeScript. Ripple's source code also may serve as a framework to your own Discord bot! See "<a href="#using-source-code">using source code</a>" for more info.

If you liked this repository, please [leave a star](https://github.com/AlphaRunic/Ripple) ‚≠ê to help promote Ripple!

## Features

Ripple is a small bot currently, but has 70+ commands. Ripple also supports quoted arguments. This means that if you want a string with spaces in it to be treated as one argument while executing a command, you may surround it in quotation marks.  
Here's an example: `::giveaway "Discord Nitro" 2d`

## Installation

Ripple can be added to your server in just a few seconds!  
Just click this link: [Invite Me! üîó](https://bit.ly/2SjjB3d)

## Using Source Code

Ripple can be cloned directly from it's repository for the latest version. To make things easier, an NPM package is provided to help install everything cleanly. In this package, a "ripple" binary is also included. Note: The command `ripple start` does not show anything logged or errored to the console, as it is a child process. To start the bot, use `npm start`.  

Install via `npm i ripple-discord-ts -g` or visit the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ripple-discord-ts).

## Credits

Ripple was created by [me](https://github.com/AlphaRunic). There is a support/hangout server for Ripple as well, which I am in. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/6BaUxyVfWM).

## Problems?

You can submit an issue pull request directly [here](https://github.com/AlphaRunic/Ripple/issues), or use `::bugreport "blah blah"` in Discord.
